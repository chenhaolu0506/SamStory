John is a freshman at UW Madison. One morning when he arrived on time for CS 400 lecture, he found no one else in the entire lecture hall except himself. He was confused. 

John checked the course schedule again and the schedule showed that he had a lecture for CS 400 at that time and that location. John fell down in the seat and started playing with his smartphone. 

Then the professor walked in, looking as confused as he was that nobody else was there. The whole class slept in! What a strange turn of events!
